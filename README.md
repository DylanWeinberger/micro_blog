# BB-8...6 Microblog Website

### MicroBlog built with Ruby using Sinatra for the framework and Activerecord for database interactions.

## Main Concepts:
### A user can...
* sign up
* sign in
* sign out
* edit their account details
* delete their account
* post micro-blogs (posts with less than 150 characters)
* see a profile page with all of their account details and micro-blog posts to date
* visit other users' profile pages
* see a page with the 10 most recent posts (the "feed")
* follow other users 
* see a list of users they follow

### Possible advanced functionality:
* a user can upload a profile picture 
* a user can follow another user without leaving the page they're on
* a post can include an uploaded photo posts with links automatically get converted into actual links
* ability to create groups of users, for other users to follow a bunch of users at the same time



### This MicroBlog is built by Dylan Weinberger and Richard Mable
